### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an entrepreneur, business-obsessed product & tech leader with expertise in B2B SaaS. Former co-founder and CPTO at Akeneo, I led and scaled product and tech activities for 11+ years to create value for 1000+ enterprise customers. I love software businesses, enjoy helping entrepreneurs and executives, and support startups as an investor, advisor, or board member.
